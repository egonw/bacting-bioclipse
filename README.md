# Bacting - the Bioclipse bundles

Bacting := acting as the Bioclipse TNG

Please read the documentation of [Bacting](https://github.com/egonw/bacting) instead.

# Copyright and authors

All code in the `/bioclipse/` folder contains Bioclipse 2 code and the headers of the individual
source code files describe who contributed to that code of that class, but unfortunately this code
ownership is not always clear. I refer to the various [Bioclipse code repositories](https://github.com/bioclipse)
for the git history for more information.
